## YourRailsApp.should_not go_untested

If you're anything like I was, you've developed a Rails application or two, and maybe even deployed it to users. But you're operating without the safety net of a reliable test suite--and in spite of what some may think, not taking the time to write tests is *adding* to your workload over time, not reducing it.

Like I said, I've been there--and in [Everday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) I want to help you build your Rails safety net the way I did, using popular tools and a simple but effective approach.

## RailsAppTesting.should be_simple

The Rails testing ecosystem is vast--trying to wrap your head around Test::Unit, MiniTest, Cucumber, mocks and stubs, and the rest can make for a daunting task, to say the least. My approach is to simplify: In [Everday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec), I **focus on three popular tools within that ecosystem** to help you build complete test suites for your Rails applications:

- **RSpec:** The test framework of choice for many Rails developers; RSpec lets you write your tests in an easy-to-read format.
- **Factory Girl:** You need test data in order to run relevant tests; Factory Girl makes this simple.
- **Capybara:** How can you simulate your applications' users' interactions? Capybara's easy-to-write, easy-to-follow syntax makes writing integration tests a breeze.

## RailsAppTesting.should be_fun

That's right! You may not believe it, but I can attest that writing tests and making them pass can make web application development more fun--maybe even addictive. That's not just me saying so; readers of [Everday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) and readers like you have told me that once they got the core concepts down and started writing tests, they had **more fun developing software**.

## You.should get_a_good_deal

I've read more than my share of programming books over the years. I know they're not cheap, and I know they can become obsolete quickly. I don't want [Everday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) to be another outdated book on your (virtual) bookshelf, so **here's what I'm offering to everyone who purchases the book now through Leanpub**:

- 100-plus **DRM-free** pages in EPUB, MOBI, and PDF formats.
- **Regular updates** as changes are made to the core testing tools.
- A **free copy of the second edition** of the book, to be available as soon as possible after Rails 4.0 is stable and released.
- A **sample Rails application** with tests at every level of the process.
- My **eternal appreciation** as a self-published author.

## And did I mention that it's **still only $9 USD?**

**Want to see more before you buy?** No problem.
