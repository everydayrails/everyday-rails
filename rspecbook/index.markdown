## YourRailsApp.should_not go_untested

If you're anything like I was, you've developed a Rails application or two, and maybe even deployed it to users. But you're operating without the safety net of a reliable test suite--and in spite of what some may think, not taking the time to write tests is *adding* to your workload over time, not reducing it.

Like I said, I've been there--and in [Everday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) I want to help you build your Rails safety net the way I did, using popular tools and a simple but effective approach.

## RailsAppTesting.should be_simple

The Rails testing ecosystem is vast--trying to wrap your head around Test::Unit, MiniTest, Cucumber, mocks and stubs, and the rest can make for a daunting task, to say the least. My approach is to simplify: In [Everday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec), I **focus on three popular tools within that ecosystem** to help you build complete test suites for your Rails applications:

- **RSpec:** The test framework of choice for many Rails developers; RSpec lets you write your tests in an easy-to-read format.
- **Factory Girl:** You need test data in order to run relevant tests; Factory Girl makes this simple.
- **Capybara:** How can you simulate your applications' users' interactions? Capybara's easy-to-write, easy-to-follow syntax makes writing integration tests a breeze.

## RailsAppTesting.should be_fun

That's right! You may not believe it, but I can attest that writing tests and making them pass can make web application development more fun--maybe even addictive. That's not just me saying so; readers of [Everday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) and readers like you have told me that once they got the core concepts down and started writing tests, they had **more fun developing software**.
