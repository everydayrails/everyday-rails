I want to say **thank you again for all the renewed interest** in my RSpec book, *Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec*. If you missed it, I wrote a post a couple of weeks ago explaining the delay and rough new timeline. I’m really sorry and appreciate your understanding!

## May book sale!

In the meantime, I’ve got a coupon code going through May, in honor of Railsconf 2024. If you haven’t yet purchased the book, **this is your chance to [snag a copy of *Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec* for $9](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec/c/railsconf2024)**. Now that I’ve formally, officially moved to a free updates for life model, the price will go up as I get closer to the final release. Just saying.

## Want a free copy of my next book project?

**I’m looking for some community support!** The updated book's sample app is a social recipe sharing site. I’m looking for some recipes to use as sample content, and would love to see your favorite dish included. If cooking’s your thing, [head over to my contact page and share](https://everydayrails.com/contact) the title of your recipe, a short description, a list of ingredients, and instructions.

You’ll get a shout out in the book and sample source (unless you wish to remain anonymous!) and, as an extra thank you, **a free copy of a companion mini-book** I’ll start working on following the updated release of *Testing with RSpec*. Be sure to **use a real email address** in the contact form so I can send you an access code!

I’m looking forward to seeing your culinary creations!
