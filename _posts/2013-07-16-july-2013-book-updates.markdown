Last month I tweeted that I'd have the promised Rails 4.0-based version of *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)* out and ready for you to read within a week or so of the Rails 4 release. Obviously, I've missed that target. I apologize, and I'd also like to explain what's taking so long.

First, let me get some excuses out of the way. Last month I left my job of eight years (with a history twice that long) to take a position with O'Reilly Media. As you might imagine, trying to get things wrapped up neatly after such a long tenure was not easy. It involved a lot of late hours and time taken from writing and editing. Getting ready for a new job and different ways of doing things I've been doing the same way for years has also reduced the time and energy I have to work on the book.

Again, I'm sorry about the bad timing, but a good opportunity arose, and I had to take it.

Let's talk about better news (for you) now:

- **Chapters 1 through 7 are updated for Rails 4.0 and Ruby 2.0.0.** And by "updated," I mean that I wrote the code from scratch and have picked through it to update things that have been bothering me, from poor grammar to poor examples of what I've been trying to explain. I rewrote major parts of a couple of chapters so that they flow better. In particular, chapter 5 (basic controller specs) works with actual code from the sample application instead of hypotheticals, and I think the changes I've made to chapter 8 (feature specs) work a little better within the grand scheme of the demo.
- **I'm still committed to replacing chapter 11 with an example of test-driving a feature, using the techniques from the book.** This, along with updates to chapter 9 (speeding up specs), represent the bulk of the coding-related work I still have to do for the book. The rest should mostly be minor edits.
- **I'm aiming to have an initial beta release available to you by the end of July, 2013.** There may be some rough edges here and there, but I think overall the meat of the book will be complete. I'll look forward to hearing your feedback. **And I want your feedback!** Any input you can provide will help me put the wraps on the book so we can all move on to other things.

Next, a couple of other notes upon which I'd appreciate your feedback:

- **I'm looking into print options.** I've received a few requests for a print version, and I'd like at least one vanity copy for myself. At this point I'm planning on going the self-published, on-demand route. If you're interested in a print version, please [let me know](/contact.html)! I'd also appreciate hearing from anyone who's had experience with the self-published printed route.
- **I'm also looking into other formats.** Specifically, what would you think about a screencast version of the book? Again, [let me know](/contact.html).

Finally, and I should have mentioned this earlier in this message: Thank you to everyone who's purchased the book, sent a nice email or tweet, said hello at a conference, or [offered suggestions](https://github.com/ruralocity/everyday_rails_rspec_rails_3_2/issues?state=open) on the Rails 3.2 version. As of a couple of days ago more than 2,300 copies of *Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec* have been sold--or, in simpler terms, about 2,300 more copies than I thought would sell when I first started publishing it on Leanpub. You've helped me make new friends, get a great new job, and put a few extra bucks in my pocket.

Thanks again!
