I'm happy and excited to let you know that a new release of _[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)_ is now available. Unlike earlier updates, this is a **major rewrite** of the book. Some of the highlights include:

- Coverage of **RSpec 3.6** and **Rails 5.1**
- An all-new sample application
- Overhauled coverage of controller testing
- Expanded coverage of API testing

Perhaps more importantly than specific RSpec or Rails features, though, this new edition also reflects my **evolving opinions on testing, and how to teach others how to test**. So even if you've read the book in the past, you may enjoy giving it another skim. Oh yeah, this is a **free update** for everyone who's ever purchased a copy in the past, as a thank you for your support. Head over to your [Leanpub library](https://leanpub.com/user_dashboard/library) to get the latest copy, if you haven't already.

In the spirit of lean publishing, I've made the **first seven chapters available**. Over the next few weeks, I'll be wrapping up and releasing the remaining chapters. Here's what to expect soon:

- A new chapter on the DRY principle as it applies to tests
- A new chapter on testing in isolation
- An updated chapter on testing the rest, including external API integration, email, file uploads, and more
- A step-by-step walk through a test-first coding session

In the meantime, if you notice anything that needs correction, please let me know by adding an issue on the [sample code's GitHub repository](https://github.com/everydayrails/everydayrails-rspec-2017/issues).

Finally, if you don't mind, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could **help me spread the word** about this new release. I'm closing in on 6,000 total sales of the book, and would love to cross that threshold by the time the final chapter of this edition is released!

Thanks again for your support, and I hope you enjoy this new edition of the book.
