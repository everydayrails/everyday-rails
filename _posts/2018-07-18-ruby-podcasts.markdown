I've been a guest on a couple of podcasts over the past few months, and I can't tell you how weird it is to be refreshing your podcast feed, and see your name pop up in the new episodes to download. I hope you'll give these shows a listen. Are there other podcasts I should try to appear on?

### [Ruby Rogues: Removing business logic from controllers](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-353-removing-business-logic-from-rails-controllers-with-aaron-sumner)

I joined Charles Max Wood and David Richards for this episode of the long-running Ruby Rogues podcast, released March 13, 2018. Our conversation centered around my blog posts on rewriting controllers to make them easier to test. We talked about the pros and cons of various approaches to this, gradual code improvement, and more.

### [The Ruby Testing Podcast](http://www.rubytestingpodcast.com/aaron-sumner)

I was honored to be guest number three on Jason Swett's brand-new, testing-centric podcast. If you ever wanted to hear more detail about how I used deliberate practice to learn testing, RSpec, and test-driven development, please check it out. I also encourage you to give the earlier two episodes a listen.
