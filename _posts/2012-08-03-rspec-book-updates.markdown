For anyone who either doesn't subscribe to updates from Leanpub, or is still on the fence about buying [my book about learning Rails testing through RSpec](http://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec), I just wanted to pass along that I pushed an update this evening with the following updates:

* Added the change log back to the book.
* Replaced usage of `==` to `eq` throughout the book to mirror best practice in RSpec expectations.
* Added clarification that you need to re-clone your development database to test *every* time you make a database change (chapter 3).
* Added a note on the great factory debate of 2012 (chapter 3).
* Added a section about the new RSpec `expect()` syntax (chapter 3).
* Fixed incomplete specs for the #edit method (chapter 5).
* Added an example of testing a non-CRUD method in a controller (chapter 5).
* Added tips on testing non-HTML output (chapter 5).
* Fixed a typo in the `:message` factory (chapter 5).
* Fixed typo in spelling of *transactions* (chapter 8).
* Added a simple technique for testing Rake tasks (chapter 10).

In addition, Leanpub is now accepting credit card transactions--so those of you who in the past couldn't use PayPal can now buy a copy. Still only nine American bucks.
