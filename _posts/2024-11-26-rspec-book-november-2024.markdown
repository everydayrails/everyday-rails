A fresh update to the 2024 edition of [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) is now available! This update continues the book's exploration of request specs. It also introduces abstracting away test data implementation details with factory_bot, and debugging tests with `binding.irb`.

If you ever purchased a copy through Leanpub, you can download this one for free, along with all future updates.

Thanks as always for your support! See you again soon with another batch of updates.
