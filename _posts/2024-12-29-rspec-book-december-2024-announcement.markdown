Hello! I'm happy to share that I've updated [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) with a new take on using RSpec and Capybara to test browser interactions via system specs. Long-time readers may recall that past editions of the book covered RSpec's _feature specs_, and included an appendix for migrating to system specs.

If you're using Windows and have a chance to check out the new examples, I'd love to hear how they're working for you--especially if they _don't_ work. I've started a [Windows support discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/everydayrails/discussions/4) for this topic.

Thank you for your support, and have a wonderful new year!
