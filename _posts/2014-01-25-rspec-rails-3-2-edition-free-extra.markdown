title: "Looking for the Rails 3.2 edition of Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec?"
excerpt: "The previous edition of my book is now a free extra with all purchases of the current edition."

I've had a few requests for the Rails 3.2-based version of *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)*, the last version of which was released in summer of 2013. I've decided to make it available as a free extra download with all purchases of the book. In a nutshell: Buy the current (Rails 4.0-based) version of the book, get the previous edition free. If you already bought the book, sign into your Leanpub account to access the download.

The zip file includes PDF, EPUB, and MOBI formats of the book and are provided as-is for anyone who may still be working with an earlier version of Rails, RSpec, Capybara, and Factory Girl.

I hope you find this useful!
