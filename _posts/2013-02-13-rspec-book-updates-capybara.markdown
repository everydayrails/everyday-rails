Hey everyone, thanks again to all of you who have purchased [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec). I hope it's gotten you on your way to better-tested apps. Sales have been chugging right along--Leanpub reports I now have more than 1,400 readers. I appreciate each and every one. I've gotten lots of great feedback in the few months since the last large update, and have been busy working to address your suggestions.

I know the tools have changed some since the last version was released, so I'm happy to share that an updated version is now available. Some big changes this time around:

- I've replaced use of `should` with the now-preferred `expect()` syntax throughout most of the book (chapters 9 and 10 excepted; see below).
- The new Capybara 2.0 DSL is now covered; chapter 8 now covers feature specs instead of request specs.
- Per suggestion, I've reworked the initial specs from chapter 3 to skip factories and focus on already available methods. Chapter 4 is now dedicated to factories.
- Copy edits throughout.

Code samples have been updated as well.

Please note that chapter 9 (Speeding Up Specs) and chapter 10 (Testing the Rest) have not been edited yet. I'll get them addressed in the coming weeks. Rails 4.0-related updates will get underway when release candidates start coming out. Those updates will all be free to you to download.

[Head on over to Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec), download the latest version, and let me know what you think.
