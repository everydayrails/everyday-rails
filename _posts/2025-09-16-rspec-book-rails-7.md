Hello! I'm happy to share that, after a tough summer but _very_ productive flight earlier this week, **the latest edition of [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) is finished and available now on Leanpub**. As always, if you've ever owned a copy of the book, this is a free update.

**I overhauled almost everything in the book**--way more than I expected when I started in spring of 2024. So it took almost a year and a half to complete, but in return, it reflects my current testing approaches and philosophies. I also restructured it to be more sustainable for me to keep up-to-date every year or two, or as long as there's demand.

New to my work? For a limited time, **get your copy of [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec for $9](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec/c/ItsAlive)** (regularly $19). Or if that's too much for your situation, [send me an email for a free lifetime license](/contact.html), no questions asked.

## What's new since 2017 (last major release)

**For the most part, everything.** The sample application is all new. Some content is reorganized to reflect modern Rails application and test suite structures. But the core message is still there: Start simple and build up to more complex tests, with a focus on pragmatism.

## What's new since April

- Rewrote the chapter on "testing the rest" to discuss **testing file uploads, email delivery, background jobs, and coverage measurement** (new to this edition)
- Rewrote the "toward test-driven development" chapter to work through **top-down TDD on a new feature** to the sample application
- Added **on-your-own exercises** to all chapters

## What's next

Now that the book and its sample code are more sustainable for me, I would love to have everything updated for the forthcoming Rails 8.1 by early 2026. I've got some other side projects that need attention first.

In the meantime, thank you as always for your support!
