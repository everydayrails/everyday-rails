Thank you to everyone who commented on [my post about free Ruby and Rails books](http://everydayrails.com/2010/07/28/free-ruby-rails-books.html) last week. I learned there are even more good, free books available for download or reading online.

### Ruby on Rails (HTML, German)

I admit I can't read German, but reader David Osterreicher recommends [Ruby on Rails 2](http://openbook.galileocomputing.de/ruby_on_rails/) as a good, example-filled introduction to Rails.

### Ruby Best Practices (PDF)

I don't know how I missed this! Gregory Bowen's book [Ruby Best Practices](http://sandal.github.com/rbp-book/pdfs/rbp_1-0.pdf) is released as open source, or you can purchase the book from O'Reilly. [Read more about the book](http://rubybestpractices.com/). Thanks to Mike, AGarren, skim, and sardukar_siet for the recommendation&mdash;I'm looking forward to looking at this one.

### The Little Book of Ruby (PDF)

Huw Collingbourne's [The Little Book of Ruby](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/The-Little-Book-Of-Ruby) is an 87-page introduction to Ruby, recommended by skim and and mikewoodhouse.

### The Book of Ruby (PDF)

Collingbourne has also written [The Book of Ruby](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/The-Book-Of-Ruby), much larger at 425 pages. Thanks to mikewoodhouse for the recommendation.

### Rails 3 in a Nutshell (HTML)

[Rails 3 in a Nutshell](http://rails-nutshell.labs.oreilly.com/) by Cody Fauser, James MacAulay, Edward Ocampo-Gooding, and John Guenin is currently under development and available in O'Reilly's Open Feedback Publishing System. It looks like the final version will be available through Creative Commons, too.

### Official Ruby and Rails documentation (HTML)

I've referred to [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) in Everyday Rails before, and reader Mike points them out as a good reference as well. Don't forget about [RDoc](http://www.ruby-doc.org/), too, as recommended by Indigo Casson.
