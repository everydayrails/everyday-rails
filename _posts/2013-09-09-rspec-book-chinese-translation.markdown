I'm excited to share with you a new [Chinese version of *Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec*](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec-cn), translated by Andor Chen and available now on Leanpub. Andor contacted me several months back about this project; I asked him to hold off on translating until the Rails 4.0-related updates were complete since I knew there would be a lot of changes. Andor worked hard to make the translation available within weeks of the updated English version, and also pointed out a few corrections to make in the original while he was at it.

All royalties for the [Chinese translation](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec-cn) will go to Andor--I'm happy he offered to help make the book available to Chinese speakers. Thanks Andor!
