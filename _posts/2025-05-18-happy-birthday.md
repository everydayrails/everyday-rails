May 19, 2025 marks Everyday Rails's fifteenth birthday!

I shared the origin story five years ago, in a [tenth birthday post](/2020/05/18/everyday-rails-10th-birthday.html). Since then, I [redesigned the site](http://localhost:4000/2020/09/17/redesign-2020-notes.html) (I still like how it looks), and wrote a few posts that you seemed to like:

- **[Rails architecture tips from route helpers](/2020/06/22/rails-routes-helpers-grammar.html)** (2020): I still love the attention to detail and developer delight that Ruby and Rails provide--in this case, a nudge toward better controller design.
- **[2 ways to test Rails log messages with RSpec](/2020/08/10/rails-log-message-testing-rspec.html)** (2020): Surprisingly to me, this is my most popular post since I published it!
- **[Old Ruby and Rails on new hardware with dev containers](/2025/04/15/old-ruby-rails-dev-container.html)** (2025): A new post from just last month--one I couldn't have written a few years earlier. But dev containers made the task _possible_, and generative AI made it possible _in a day_.

I also announced a fully-updated version of the book spun from this site, **[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec/c/everyday-rails-15)**. The latest updates are almost done, and are free for anyone who's ever bought a copy through Leanpub. And through May, this link to the book gets you your _own_ lifetime copy for just $9.

## The future

I've got plans for expanding Everyday Rails beyond the traditional blog format it's used since day one. I'm hoping to build and expand my mailing list (since that's the thing these days), but don't worry--it won't be yet another Substack.

In the meantime, thank you for all of your support over the years. I appreciate you!
