I'm still working on my series on [adding ACL to Rails apps](http://everydayrails.com/2010/06/16/authorization-restful-acl-1.html) but ran across a site pertinent to an earlier discussion. My first two posts in _Everyday Rails_ were about getting Rails apps off the ground; first with a [step by step walkthrough of the process](http://everydayrails.com/2010/05/19/bootstrapping-a-rails-app.html) and then by [created an application template](http://everydayrails.com/2010/05/22/bootstrapping-rails-template.html) to do the heavy lifting for us. Turns out there's an even faster way--visit [You've Got Rails](http://www.youvegotrails.com)/ (created by [Justin Briteen](http://twitter.com/jbritten)), check the boxes for the features you need in your app, download the template, and use it to create your app.

Now, if you do go this route, don't get lazy--rather, use it as a learning opportunity. Take a look at the contents of the template to see what's going on. It will help you get more familiar with the general functionality of application templates so as you grow as a Rails developer you'll be able to create templates that do exactly what you need them to do, rather than relying on someone else to do the work for you.
