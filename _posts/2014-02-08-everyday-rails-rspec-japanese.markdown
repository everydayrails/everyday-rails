I'm happy to tell you that *Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec* has been [translated to Japanese](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec-jp) and is now available on Leanpub. The team of translators has worked hard over the past several weeks to not only deliver this edition for Japanese-reading audiences, but also help me make the English version better by making several suggestions. For their efforts, they will receive 100% of the book royalties for the Japanese version.

*Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec* is my practical guide to learning to test your Rails application using RSpec, Capybara, and Factory Girl. It's also available in [Chinese](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec-cn) and [English](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec).
