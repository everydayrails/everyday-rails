I've just released another batch of progress on the 2024 edition of [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec).

This release includes an overhauled chapter on testing controllers, using RSpec request specs.

If you ever purchased a copy through Leanpub, you can download this one for free, along with all future updates.

I appreciate your support!
