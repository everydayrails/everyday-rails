After a long summer, I'm happy to announce that *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)* has been updated for RSpec 3 and Rails 4.1 (and beyond). If you've already purchased the book, head over to Leanpub to download the latest edition for free. If you're new to the book, I hope you'll check it out.

The book has evolved a lot since I first wrote those blog posts here, more than three years ago. However, the core message and approach are the same: You need to learn to test your Rails applications, and a great way to learn is by testing code you've already written.

Here's a brief rundown of what's new:

- Coverage of RSpec 3--RSpec 3.1 is used in this edition's examples.
- Support for Rails 4.1 (and newer)--specifically, built-in support for Spring.
- A bunch of new content around "testing the rest"--testing your app's API, use of external APIs, etc. I'm really happy with how this turned out, and hope you are, too.
- New formatting, just in case I decide to do a print version. (That's still a big if.) I've opted for dimensions more like you'd see from books by mainstream technical publishers.

Thanks as always for your support!
