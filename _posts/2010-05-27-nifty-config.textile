Continuing with my series on the "Nifty Generators":http://github.com/ryanb/nifty-generators gem by Ryan Bates (see "part 1 on nifty_layout":/2010/05/25/nifty-generators.html), in this post I want to talk about a second feature this gem provides, called <code>nifty_config</code>. With <code>nifty_config</code>, you can quickly create a set of global variables for your application, dependent on the environment in which your Rails application is currently running.

To get started, generate a config file:

{% highlight bash %}
  $ script/generate nifty_config
{% endhighlight %}

This adds two files to your app: A configuration file called <code>app_config.yml</code> located inside <code>config</code>, and an initializer (to load the config file when your Rails app starts) in <code>config/initializers</code>.

{% highlight yaml %}
  development:
    domain: localhost:3000

  test:
    domain: test.host

  production:
    domain: example.com
{% endhighlight %}

From there you can customize the default values created by the generator. For example, I use the Passenger preference pane for Mac OS X to manage multiple local development environments, instead of running <code>script/server</code> within my apps. The preference pane defaults to <code>appname.local</code> as its convention, so I use that as my local domain.

You can also add your own values to the YAML file. For me, the most useful addition is an e-mail address for mailers to use when sending e-mail. I might use a personal account during development, but a more official contact address once the app is in production. I sometimes also include a <code>name</code> value for each environment, mainly because there are times I'll start on application development before I know what it's going to be called--so I use some sort of code name during development, and want to have placeholders for the final name. This isn't always a good practice, but it generally works for me. It's no substitute for error-checking your views and your copy before deployment, though.

Here's what a completed <code>config.yml</code> file might look like for me:

{% highlight yaml %}
  development:
    name: My Great App Development
    domain: mygreatapp.local
    email: devaccount@mygreatapp.com

  test:
    name: My Great App Test
    domain: test.host
    email: devaccount@mygreatapp.com

  production:
    name: My Great App
    domain: mygreatapp.com
    email: help@mygreatapp.com
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="panel">
  <p>
  <strong>Don't forget:</strong> The values in your <code>app_config.yml</code> file are loaded when your application starts, so you'll need to restart your application after you first create the file or whenever you make changes to its values.
  </p>
</div>

From there, it's just a matter of calling up your values wherever they're needed. All you need to do is refer to <code>APP_CONFIG[:value]</code> within your application's code to use whatever you assigned to <code>value</code> in your <code>config.yml</code> file, for the environment in which your app is currently running. For example, given the above configuration file, <code>APP_CONFIG[:email]</code> would return <code>devaccount@mygreatapp.com</code> if I were running the code in development mode; it would return <code>help@mygreatapp.com</code> if I were in production.

So in a standard Rails view file, you might include your application's name like

{% highlight erb %}
  <h1>Welcome to <%= APP_CONFIG[:name] %>!</h1>
{% endhighlight %}

Using Haml, I'd write the above like

{% highlight haml %}
  %h1= "Welcome to #{APP_CONFIG[:name]}!"
{% endhighlight %}

Or in a mailer model like

{% highlight ruby %}
  def message(sent_at = Time.now)
    subject    "#{APP_CONFIG[:name]}: New message received"
    recipients @message.recipient.email
    from       APP_CONFIG[:email]
    sent_on    sent_at
    
    body       :greeting => 'Hi,'
  end
{% endhighlight%}

Here's a simple example of using APP_CONFIG values outside of view-type files. In this case, I wanted to limit the number of people who could create accounts while I was scaling up. I created a <code>max_users</code> value in my <code>app_config.yml</code> file, then called the below method with a <code>before_filter</code> call in the controller that created new user accounts.

{% highlight ruby %}

  def room_for_user?
    if User.count >= APP_CONFIG[:max_users]
      flash[:error] = 'Sorry, we have all the users we can handle right now.'
      redirect_to root_path
      false
    else
      true
    end
  end

{% endhighlight %}

That's all for Nifty Generators' nifty_config feature. These are my uses for it, but I recommend experimenting with it in your own apps. Next time I'll close out my series on Nifty Generators with <code>nifty_scaffold</code>, the real meat of this very useful gem.
