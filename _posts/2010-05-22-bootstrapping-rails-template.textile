title: Bootstrapping Rails with an app template
excerpt: "Now that you've seen how I configure my Rails applications out of the gate, here's a way to do the same thing with one command."

In my first post I walked through "the steps I take when creating a Rails application from scratch":/2010/05/19/bootstrapping-a-rails-app.html. I should clarify that those are the steps I _would_ take if it weren't for app templates, a very useful feature introduced in Rails 2.3. Simply put, create a Ruby file like the following and put it somewhere you can access it--in this example I'll just keep it in my Home folder on my Mac, and call it <code>rails_template.rb</code>:

{% highlight ruby %}
# rails_template.rb

# set up the databases
rake "db:create", :env => 'development'
rake "db:create", :env => 'test'

# install required gems
gem "haml"
rake "gems:install"
run "haml --rails ."

# run nifty generators
generate :nifty_layout, "--haml"
generate :nifty_config

# remove unneeded files from public directory
run "rm public/index.html"
run "rm public/images/rails.png"

# set up git
file ".gitignore", <<-END
.DS_Store
log/*.log
tmp/**/*
config/database.yml
db/*.sqlite3
END

run "touch tmp/.gitignore log/.gitignore vendor/.gitignore"
run "cp config/database.yml config/database.example"

git :init
git :add => "."
git :commit => "-a -m 'create initial application'"
{% endhighlight %}

Now, to use it, create your new Rails app with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ rails -d mysql mygreatapp -m ~/rails_template.rb
{% endhighlight %}

and watch the magic happen.

This is a very basic app template, but given their recipe-like nature, lots of templates are available on GitHub and elsewhere to help get your Rails applications off the ground. In particular, check out Mike Gunderloy's "BigOldRailsTemplate":http://github.com/ffmike/BigOldRailsTemplate, which includes an authentication system, pagination, database options (instead of my MySQL-only example above), testing, and other services.

My advice is to start with a basic app template, then expand it as you build a collection of go-to gems and plugins. A great place to get started is by checking out the "Railscasts episode on app templates":http://railscasts.com/episodes/148-app-templates-in-rails-2-3, as well as Ryan Bates' "repository of sample templates":http://github.com/ryanb/rails-templates on GitHub.
