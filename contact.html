  all the fieldsâ€”I just need it to be able to reply, not to sell or market.
  I do my best to reply in a reasonable amount of time, but please

  If you have a question about something from
  <em>Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</em>, please direct it to the

</p>

<p>
  Heads up, I will probably not respond to the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Offers to translate my book: I'm flattered, but I am not interested in
    adding translations at this time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Requests to write guest posts on Everyday Rails: Sorry, this site is a
    purely personal venture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Requests to post to your company or personal project: If it's interesting
    to me, and solves a need I have, I may write something up about it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Offers to improve my SEO, or write any software for hire.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Thanks!
