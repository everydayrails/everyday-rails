title: About Everyday Rails
excerpt: "A blog about writing software, usually using Ruby on Rails,
but often not."
---

_Everyday Rails_ is about getting stuff done as a software developer. It's usually about using Ruby on Rails, but often times, it's not. It's about finding the best tools, libraries, and practices to help you get your apps to production. I try to write here at least once or twice a month, but don't hold me to that.

## Some background

My name is Aaron Sumner, and I've been using the Ruby on Rails web application framework since the relatively early days, after ten-plus years of doing web development the old-fashioned way with brittle, procedural spaghetti written mostly in Perl and PHP. Rails was my first actual framework, and I've never looked back. For the work I do it's been perfect, from the tool itself to the supporting cast of Rubyists and the expertise (and code) they share to get the most from the framework and the language.

However, I feel like there's something missing in the multitude of existing Rails books, podcasts, blogs, and mailing lists. From my observations while helping other people get up and running with Rails, I can see how there would be a disconnect between the materials out there for the _very_ beginner and for developers who've got a laundry list of gems they've published on GitHub. I want to help those people who have figured out the basics but are looking for help with the next steps.
