_Everyday Rails_ is about using the Ruby on Rails web application framework to get stuff done as a web developer. It's about finding the best plugins, gems, and practices to get the most from Rails and help you get your apps to production.

## Some background

My name is Aaron Sumner, and I've been using the Ruby on Rails web application framework since the relatively early days, after ten-plus years of doing web development the old-fashioned way with brittle, procedural spaghetti written mostly in Perl and PHP. Rails was my first actual framework, and I've never looked back. For the work I do it's been perfect, from the tool itself to the supporting cast of Rubyists and the expertise (and code) they share to get the most from the framework and the language.

However, I feel like there's something missing in the multitude of existing Rails books, podcasts, blogs, and mailing lists. From my observations while helping other people get up and running with Rails, I can see how there would be a disconnect between the materials out there for the _very_ beginner and for developers who've got a laundry list of gems they've published on GitHub. I want to help those people who have figured out the basics but are looking for help with the next steps.

## The plan

My goal is to share general, pragmatic tips to show how I use Rails (almost) every day to get stuff done on the job. I'll focus mostly on making things using Ruby on Rails, attempting to glean a better understanding of why the plugins, gems, and other Ruby parts do what they do to help me make as good an application as I can. If you learn something in the process, all the better.

## Colophon

_Everyday Rails_ is published using the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) static site generator. I use [Atom](http://atom.io) and Vim to edit this site and my Rails projects.
