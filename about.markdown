title: About Left of the Dev (formerly Everyday Rails)
excerpt: "A blog about writing software for fun, good, and sometimes profit.
but often not."
---

**Left of the Dev is about writing software for fun, good, and sometimes profit.** Historically,
it focused on the Ruby on Rails web framework, but these days it can and will touch on any
software-related topic, including testing, Django, game development, agentic coding,
security practices, and developer experience.

## Some background

My name is Aaron Sumner. I've been writing software professionally for more than thirty years,
in (to name a few languages, in roughly chronological order) BASIC, AppleScript, Perl, PHP,
Ruby, Python, Go, Lua, and others. I've shared my thoughts and experiences as a developer
since 2010, starting this site as Everyday Rails before rebranding as Left of the Dev in 2025.

**Philosophies and personality quirks** behind the articles you'll read here:

- **I'm a strong believer in the net good of open source.** It is far from perfect. But I admire
  people who share openly in the software world, and do my best to emulate them.
- **I do not learn well from first principles.** I usually need to start with a real problem,
  get a good-enough solution together, pick out the key concepts, and deep dive into those
  concepts as need or interest apply. Don't expect a lot of _Hello World_ tutorials here.
- **If someone else open-sourced code that does what I want, I'll run with it.** I'm busy and
  don't have time to reinvent wheels. I'm guessing you don't, either. If you can do it
  better? Sure. If you really want to learn a thing? Go for it. Those traits don't usually
  apply to me (see: learning from first principles).
- **Developer experience matters.** Down with redundant boilerplate code and arcane command
  line flags. In with code generators and savvy command aliasing! I'm old and only have so
  may keyboard taps left in me. Let's automate the mundane and save our fingers for work
  that matters (and/or is fun).
- **I am pragmatically bullish on AI-assisted software development.** I get a lot of mileage
  out of agentic tools in my daily work. I also have legit concerns about artificial
  intelligence (ethical use or lack thereof, environmental effects, etc.). I know we're in a bubble.
  I am balancing personally, and while I'll share things I've learned, I
  also won't make you feel bad if you're not using Claude or Codex or whatever tomorrow's
  hot new robot is. And I don't care to hear from people on the extremes of this discussion.
- **Shiny things are fun, but don't roll them straight into production.** I try to keep up
  on emerging tools and trends. Sometimes I have a quiet Friday afternoon to noodle around
  with them, and share my impressions here. These are not endorsements!
