Below is a list of books and other resources I recommend to anyone interested in learning Rails, Ruby, and Rails application testing. If you buy any of these, please consider purchasing through the provided Amazon affiliate links. I get a small cut that helps defray the expenses of keeping *Everyday Rails* going. Thanks for your support.

## Learning Rails

### Agile Web Development with Rails (Fourth Edition)

Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hanson’s *Agile Rails* is how I first learned Ruby and Rails back in 2005. It was in its first edition back then, and Rails has evolved a great deal since that time. I’ve kept an eye on subsequent versions of the book, though, and still think it’s among the best ways to get started with the framework. Of note, *Agile Rails* now does a much better job at introducing testing early on, rather than treating it as an afterthought.

### Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example

Michael Hartl's *Rails Tutorial*, does the best job of any Rails introduction I've seen of presenting Rails in the way you'll be developing in it--that is, in a test-driven fashion.

### Learning Rails 3

Simon St. Laurent, Edd Dumbill, and Eric Gruber provide a different take on getting started with Rails. If your comfort level is more with the front-end of things--say, as a web designer--this may be the Rails book for you. (Full disclosure: I served as a technical editor for this book.)

### Rails Recipes: Rails 3 Edition

I'm a big fan of recipe-style books, and Chad Fowler's *Rails Recipes* is a must-have for any Rails developer's bookshelf. It's useful whether you've got an immediate problem to solve, or if you're just curious how a well-versed Rails developer would accomplish a given task. (Note: This is the updated version for Rails 3.)

### Crafting Rails Applications: Expert Practices for Everyday Rails Development

José Valim takes you on a more in-depth exploration of the Rails framework through a series of exercises that not only teach you more about Rails internals, but deliver commonly-used functions in web applications. Read this book when you're ready to take your Rails expertise to the next level.

## Learning Ruby

### Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide

The venerable "Pickaxe Book" from Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler, and Andy Hunt is a great follow-up to *Agile Rails* or *Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial*. It takes you through Ruby’s internals and can help you understand some of the quote-unquote magic that Rails is sometimes accused of performing.

### Eloquent Ruby

This is my favorite Ruby book and is recommended reading once you've got the basics of the language down, or if you're comfortable with Rails and ready to know how its underpinnings work. Russ Olsen covers everything from proper style to DSL creation to metaprogramming. Easy to read, yet full of great information.

### The Well-Grounded Rubyist

This book by long-time Rubyist David Black is also a solid second book on Ruby.

### Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer

My other favorite Ruby book; Sandi Metz's *POODIR* has become the go-to for honing skills in object-oriented design. I can't recommend it enough.

## Testing Rails

### Rails Test Prescriptions: Keeping Your Applications Healthy

Noel Rappin's *Rails Test Prescriptions* is my favorite book on the art and craft of test-driven development in Rails. Noel introduces you to popular testing frameworks for Ruby and Javascript, as well as associated concepts like stubs, mocks, and factories. If you're coming to Rails from an environment where automated testing was uncommon or unheard of, I strongly recommend picking up this book.

### Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec: A Practical Approach to Test-Driven Development

My little, self-published book on getting started with Rails testing, in which I strip out the complexity and focus on a small core of useful utilities to help you get your Rails applications tested. Better for people totally new to testing than for those who have some comfort with it.

### The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber and Friends

*The RSpec Book* by David Chelimsky, Dave Astels, Bryan Helmkamp, Dan North, Zach Dennis, and Aslak Hellesøy covers RSpec and Cucumber as they pertain to the Rails framework and to Ruby in general. The authors are also the developers of the tools covered, and staunch believers in behavior-driven development. Not my favorite book on the subject, but a good way to understand how the different parts of BDD fit together.

### The Cucumber Book: Behaviour-Driven Development for Testers and Developers

A companion of sorts to *The RSpec Book*; this is a thorough introduction to Cucumber, including good coverage for incorporating it into Rails applications. I don't use Cucumber on a daily basis these days, but it's still an important piece of the Rails ecosystem and worth being familiar with.
