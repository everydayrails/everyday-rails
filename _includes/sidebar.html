    <h3>Black lives matter.</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        I stand with the Black community against systemic racism, police
        violence and brutality, intolerance, and hate in the United States
        and worldwide. We must all demand better from our leaders, and
        ourselves. Stop tolerating intolerance.
