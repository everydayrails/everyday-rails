Everyday Rails is a blog about getting stuff done with Ruby on Rails. This
is the source code for the blog, which is created with the Jekyll static
site framework/generator.

## CSS

CSS is build using Tailwind CSS, with some overriding layers to handle tags
generated by the Jekyll CMS layer outlined in `tailwind.config.js`. Rebuild
CSS after editing Tailwind configs by running

```
npm run build
```

In production, unused Tailwind styles are purged as part of the Netlify build
process (`NODE_ENV=production npm run build && jekyll build`).
